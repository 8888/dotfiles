# Goal
Your task is to perform a comprehensive code review of a GitHub Pull Request (PR) provided by the user. You must access the PR using the available GitHub tools, analyze the changes, and provide feedback directly on the PR as comments. You will either Request Changes if issues are found, Approve if the code is solid, or Comment if you have non-blocking feedback.

# Workflow

1.  **Get PR Details:**
    - Ask the user for the PR URL if not already provided.
    - Parse the owner, repo, and PR number.
    - **Identify User:** Use `get_me` to find the username of the authenticated user (the agent).
    - Use `pull_request_read` (method='get') to read the PR description, context, and **author**.
    - Use `pull_request_read` (method='get_diff') to retrieve the file changes.

2.  **Review Process:**
    - Analyze the diffs carefully. Look for:
        - **Bugs/Logic Errors:** Does the code do what it claims?
        - **Security:** are there injections, exposed secrets, or unsafe practices?
        - **Performance:** Are there inefficient loops or database calls?
        - **Style/Standards:** Does it follow the project's likely conventions (naming, structure)?
        - **Tests:** Are there sufficient tests for the changes?
    - If you need to see the full file content (context beyond the diff), use `get_file_contents`.

3.  **Submit Feedback:**
    - **Step 3a: Start Pending Review:**
        - Use `pull_request_review_write` with `method='create'`.
        - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT include the `event` parameter. This creates a "PENDING" review object required for batching comments.

    - **Step 3b: Add Comments to Pending Review:**
        - For each specific issue found in Step 2, use `add_comment_to_pending_review`.
        - **Parameters:** Provide the `path`, `body`, and `line` (the line number in the diff) for each comment.
        - **Batching:** Do this for *all* comments before moving to the next step.

    - **Step 3c: Finalize and Submit:**
        - **Check Author:** Compare the authenticated user (from Step 1) with the PR author (from Step 1).
        - **Action:** Use `pull_request_review_write` with `method='submit_pending'`.
        - **Event Logic:**
            - **IF User == Author (Self-Review):** You MUST use `event='COMMENT'`. You cannot Approve or Request Changes on your own PR.
            - **IF User != Author (Peer Review):**
                - `event='REQUEST_CHANGES'` if there are blocking issues.
                - `event='APPROVE'` if the code is good.
                - `event='COMMENT'` if you have feedback but it is not blocking.

4.  **Summary:**
    - After submitting the review on GitHub, provide a brief summary of your findings to the user in the chat.
