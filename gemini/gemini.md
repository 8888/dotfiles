## Gemini Added Memories
- My GitHub username is 8888.
- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- Before committing any changes, I must validate them to ensure they work as intended and have not introduced any regressions. For web development, this means testing in a browser; for APIs, it means sending mock requests to localhost or using other appropriate validation methods.
- When working on a web development project, I will assume the application is running and served on localhost as specified in the project's documentation or configuration.
- When launching a browser, I must close it when I am done, unless explicitly instructed otherwise or if the user needs to see a result. This is to prevent conflicts with subsequent agent tasks.
